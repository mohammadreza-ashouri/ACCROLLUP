/**
 * @title AccRollup
 * @dev This contract interfaces between Ethereum and a ACCROLLUP blockchain.
 * It tracks the history of the ACCROLLUP chain, is the sole arbiter of block
 * validity and tracks all tokens managed by the ACCROLLUP chain.
 * New blocks on the sidechain are submitted to this contract and recorded as
 * pending for a period of time called the confirmation period, which is defined
 * in Configurable.sol, during which anyone can audit the block for errors.
 *
 * This implements functions which allow accounts on Ethereum to record "hard"
 * transactions which the ACCROLLUP chain must execute.
 *
 * If submitted blocks are invalid, anyone may submit a fraud proof to this
 * contract to prove that the block contains some error, which will cause the
 * block to be reverted. If fraud is proven, the operator will be penalized and
 * the prover will be rewarded.
